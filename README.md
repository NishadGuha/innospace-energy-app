# innospace-energy-app
This React Native app has been setup with the help of the ``expo`` CLI.\
\
In order to setup the expo cli, please first install it on your local machine. Make sure you have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After that, in your command line, run the following command:
```
npm install --global expo-cli
```
After this, ``cd`` into the folder where this repository is clones and in order to start the app, please run the command:
```
expo start
```
If expo does not automatically open the browser for you, you need to visit the localhost url at [port 19002](http://localhost:19002/).\
\
Hereafter, please select the option ``Run in web browser on the left panel``.\
\
Expo should open the app in the localhost url at [port 19006](http://localhost:19006/).\
\
You should now be viewing the app in a browser. In order to optimize the viewing of the app for a mobile device, please open development toold by using the inspect element feature or otherwise. In macOS, this is done in Google Chrome by using ``command + option + j`` and in windows by using the ``F12`` key and select the icon for mobile devices on the top bar. It is recommended to view the app in a mode for a device such as the iPhone 12 pro or any other mainstream modern mobile device for an optimal experience.\
\
In order to stop the app, you can go back to your command line interface where you started the app and press ``control + c``.
